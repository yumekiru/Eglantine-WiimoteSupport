# Eglantine WiimoteSupport fork

Adds direct Mayflash DolphinBar input for MotionPlus / Motion 2-in-1 Wii Remotes. Two remotes provide one player's independent left/right motion streams, with D-pad stick emulation and configurable button mappings.

[Windows builds](https://github.com/yumekiru/Eglantine-WiimoteSupport/releases) · [Setup, controls, verification and limitations](README-WIIMOTES.md)

Experimental, AI-assisted implementation. Live tests verified both gyro streams and game input; perfect Joy-Con equivalence or compatibility with every sport is not claimed.

# Lichii

Lichii is an experimental, open-source Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 emulator written in C++. It builds on Eglantine, Eden, yuzu and Sudachi, preserving their contributions while developing this fork's game compatibility and renderer fixes.

This is an independent fork, not an official release of those upstream projects. Lichii is not affiliated with Nintendo.

## Downloads and setup

Published builds belong on this fork's [releases page](https://github.com/zortos293/Eglantine/releases). The repository still uses its historical Eglantine name; the desktop application is now Lichii.

On Windows, extract the entire build archive and run **lichii.exe**. Only use games and system files you have legally obtained. Games, keys and firmware are not included.

### Existing saves and settings

The rebrand intentionally retains the existing Eden/Eglantine data directories and configuration keys. It does not move or delete saves, settings or shader caches. Back up your saves before testing experimental builds.

## Compatibility and issue reports

Compatibility and performance vary by game, hardware and driver. Rendering errors, stutters and crashes remain possible. Passing automated tests does not establish that a game renders correctly, and this project makes no universal frame-rate guarantee.

When [reporting an issue](https://github.com/zortos293/Eglantine/issues), include:

- The exact build, game version, CPU, GPU and driver version.
- Relevant settings and steps to reproduce the problem.
- A screenshot and the log from the affected session, after checking it for personal information.

Do not upload game files, keys, firmware or private account information.

## Building and contributing

See the [build guide](docs/Build.md), [user documentation](docs/user/README.md) and [coding policy](docs/policies/Coding.md). Some inherited documentation and internal build target names still use upstream names. The GUI build target remains `yuzu`; its output is `lichii.exe` on Windows and `lichii` on other desktop platforms.

Keep changes focused and distinguish code-level checks from actual gameplay testing.

## Artwork

The supplied Lichii logo, icon and library artwork are in [dist/branding](dist/branding). Windows, Linux and macOS icon resources are generated from that artwork by [Generate-LichiiIcons.ps1](tools/Generate-LichiiIcons.ps1).

## Credits and license

Lichii inherits the work of the Eglantine, Eden, yuzu and Sudachi projects and their contributors, including Eglantine's original developer Camille LaVey. Original copyright notices and third-party licenses are retained.

See [LICENSE.txt](LICENSE.txt) and the source files for applicable license terms.
